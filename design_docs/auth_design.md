# Authentication and Google Sheets API Access Design

## Overview
This document outlines the design for handling authentication and session management, as well as integrating Google Sheets API access within our application.

## Session Management Flow
1. **User Registration/Login**:
   - Users register or log in to the application using the built-in authentication system (e.g., Django's authentication).
   - This involves creating a user account, verifying credentials, and establishing a session.

2. **Session Handling**:
   - A session is created for the user upon login, maintaining their state across requests.
   - Session data includes user preferences, authentication status, and other relevant information.

## Google Sheets API Access Flow
1. **OAuth 2.0 Authentication**:
   - Users are redirected to Google's OAuth 2.0 consent screen to authenticate with their Google account.
   - They grant permission for the application to access their Google Sheets.

2. **Token Management**:
   - The application receives an access token to interact with the Google Sheets API on behalf of the user.
   - A refresh token may also be received to obtain new access tokens when needed.

## Integration of Both Flows
- **Unified User Experience**: Integrate both flows to provide a seamless experience. After logging in, prompt users to connect their Google account if not already done.
- **Profile Management**: Store Google account information and tokens in user profiles, managing both application-specific and Google-specific data.
- **Seamless Transitions**: Use session data to track Google account connection status and guide users through the OAuth flow when accessing Google Sheets features.

## Security Considerations
- **Secure Storage**: Use secure storage mechanisms for OAuth tokens.
- **HTTPS**: Ensure the application is served over HTTPS to protect user data.
- **Token Expiry**: Handle token expiry and refresh tokens as needed.

## Token Refresh Logic Implementation
To ensure continuous access to the Google Sheets API, we implement a token refresh logic using the refresh token obtained during the initial OAuth 2.0 authentication.

### Steps:
1. **Store Refresh Token**: Securely store the refresh token in the session or database.
2. **Check Token Expiry**: Before making an API call, check if the current access token is about to expire by comparing the current time with the `expiresAt` timestamp.
3. **Request New Access Token**: If the token is expired or about to expire, use the refresh token to request a new access token from Google's OAuth 2.0 server.
4. **Update Session**: Update the session with the new access token and its expiry time.

### Implementation Example:
- Use the `google-auth-library` to handle OAuth 2.0 operations.
- Refresh the token a few minutes before it expires to ensure uninterrupted access.
- Implement error handling to manage cases where the refresh token might be invalid or revoked.
